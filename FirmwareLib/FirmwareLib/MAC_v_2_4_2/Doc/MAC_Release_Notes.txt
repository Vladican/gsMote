Known issues
- AVR GCC tool chain for Xmega: library bug with printf functionality
- Firmware that is larger than 64k created with WinAVR-20080610 GCC for ATxmega128A1 shows undefined behavior; e.g. 32 MHz oscillator cannot be enabled. In the current Xmega WinAVR tool chain (version WinAVR-20080610) there is a bug for images larger than 64k size. This will be fixed by setting the ramp Z register to 0 at program start. Once the tool chain is fixed this shall be removed.
- printf functionality provided by WinAVR-20080610 release used with ATxmega128A1 causes undefined behavior. This has impact to example applications, like Performance_Test.
- Early Radio Controller Boards (RCB) version 5.3 labeled without IEEE address do not have an IEEE address stored into the external EEPROM. Early Radio Extender Boards (REB) version 5.0 might have external EEPROM values stored in the wrong format.

Known Issues
- Firmware that is larger than 64k created with WinAVR GCC for ATxmega128A1 shows undefined behavior; e.g. 32 MHz oscillator cannot be enabled.
- printf functionality provided by WinAVR-20080610 release used with ATxmega128A1 causes undefined behavior.
